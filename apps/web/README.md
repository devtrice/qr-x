Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Editing docs content

Our docs are generated. Use the following steps to make adjustments to the content and update the website to match:

- make your edits to the documentation in the `api-code-examples/api.mjs` file
- cd into the `scripts` folder
- run `npm install` if you have not run it in this folder previously
- run `node generate-api-pages.js` to generate the doc files for the website

### Style / grammar guide

Follow the style that has already been layed out. But as a general rule of thumb, follow normal English punctuation, but favor brevity over proper grammar. In other words, use capital letters at the start of sentences, and end them with a period, but sentences can be fragments if that gets the point across quicker.
